# Performance

Loading performance is key to streamlining your operations. Here are a few steps we recommend to take to ensure your Forest is optimized.

#### 1. Show only Smart fields you absolutely need <a href="#1.-show-only-smart-fields-you-absolutely-need" id="1.-show-only-smart-fields-you-absolutely-need"></a>

**Smart fields** are fields that require a computation: they can therefore lead to a decrease of performance while loading your page. [Hide](<../.gitbook/assets/customizing the table view>) any field in your collection that is not required.

#### 2. Reduce the number of records per page <a href="#2.-reduce-the-number-of-records-per-page" id="2.-reduce-the-number-of-records-per-page"></a>

#### 3. Reduce the number of fields displayed <a href="#3.-reduce-the-number-of-fields-displayed" id="3.-reduce-the-number-of-fields-displayed"></a>

You can hide some fields in your table view; this will not prevent you from seeing them in the record details view.

#### 4. Show only Relationship fields you absolutely need <a href="#4.-show-only-relationship-fields-you-absolutely-need" id="4.-show-only-relationship-fields-you-absolutely-need"></a>

Relationship fields are links to other collection records within your table view:

Having Relationship fields can decrease your performance, especially if your tables have a lot of records. Therefore you should display only those you actually need and use!
