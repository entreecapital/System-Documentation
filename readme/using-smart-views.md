# Using Smart Views

A Smart View is page specially designed by your technical team using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is useful when you need extensive customization.

If you think you need a Smart view, ask your technical team to design it for you.

To apply a Smart view you created, turn on the Layout Editor mode **(1)**, click on the table button **(2)** and drag & drop your Smart View's name in first position inside the dropdown **(3)**:

Your view will refresh automatically. You can now turn off the Layout Editor mode **(4)**.

Once your Smart view is applied, it will also be displayed in your record's related data.

As of today, it's **not** possible to set different views for your table/summary/related data views.
