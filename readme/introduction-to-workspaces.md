# Introduction to Workspaces

Workspaces are our latest solution to building powerful custom applications for your operators.

Our vision is that, in the future, workspaces will become the place where operators handle 100% of their work. The "Data" tab will always exist, but it will become secondary, when you need to deep dive into your data for some occasional cases.

A Workspace is single web page that you can build using components. Once built, it should become your operators' main tool to do their day-to-day work.

A Component is a piece of UI that helps you do your day-to-day work. For now, there are 4 components: Text, Chart, Collection and Button. In the future, there will be many more!

What you see now are only the first steps of workspaces. We're currently working on making them much more powerfull with the following next iterations:

* **Record-selection**: select a record either using the Collection component or using the new Search component. Once a record is selected, display its information using the Field component or filter specific components using this record \[DONE]
* **Smart-action forms**: embed your smart action forms into workspaces
* **Multi-page**: create more than one page for the same workspace and link them together
* **Smoother experience**: auto-save, copy/paste, undo, keyboard shortcuts
