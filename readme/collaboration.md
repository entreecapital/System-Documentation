# Collaboration

Using an efficient back office tool is great, but using it collaboratively is even more powerful!

This is why we've laid the foundations of what will grow to be an essential tool of your day-to-day work:

* ​[Notes](<../.gitbook/assets/communicate with notes>) - Leave a note and communicate around a specific record.
* ​[Approval workflow](<../.gitbook/assets/manage roles>) - Have specific users approve actions of other users
