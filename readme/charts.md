# Charts

KPIs are paramount to follow day by day. Your customers’ growth, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Paid VS Free accounts are some common examples.

Charts can be added in 2 places:

* In the **Analytics** tab of every record of a collection

#### What types of charts exist in Forest Admin? <a href="#what-types-of-charts-exist-in-forest-admin" id="what-types-of-charts-exist-in-forest-admin"></a>

Forest Admin can render six types of charts:

* Single value (Number of customers, MRR, …)
* Repartition (Number of customers by countries, Paid VS Free, …)

Only the 5 biggest categories will be displayed separately. All the others will go into a 6th "Other" category.

* Time-based (Number of signups per month, …)
* Percentage (% of paying customers, …)
* Objective (Orders passed per year VS objective, …)
* Leaderboard (Companies who emitted the most transactions, …)

Ensure you’ve enabled the `Layout Editor` mode to add, edit or delete a chart.

In the following pages, you'll learn how to create all types of charts.
